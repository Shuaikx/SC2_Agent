StarCraft II is a challenging benchmark for AI agents due to micro-level operations and macro-awareness. Previous works, such as Alphastar and SCC, achieve impressive performance on tackling StarCraft II , however, still exhibit deficiencies in long-term strategic planning and strategy interpretability. Emerging large language model (LLM) agents, presents the immense potential in solving intricate tasks.
